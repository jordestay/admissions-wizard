### **"Admissions Sorting Wizard"**

A hybrid tool combining the **Admissions Fit Score** and the **Wizard Concept** to provide a personalized, guided experience that evaluates a user's fit with their target schools.

---

### **Overview**

The Admissions Sorting Wizard walks users through a series of questions about their academic, extracurricular, and personal backgrounds, then generates a tailored "Admissions Fit Score" for each selected school. The wizard also provides actionable insights and personalized recommendations to enhance their application.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **Guided Input Process**:
    
    - Users answer a step-by-step series of engaging questions about:
        - **Academics**: GPA, test scores, coursework rigor.
        - **Extracurriculars**: Clubs, leadership roles, volunteer work.
        - **Essays/Personal Brand**: Strength of narrative or unique experiences.
        - **Preferences**: School size, location, culture, etc.
2. **Dynamic Admissions Fit Score**:
    
    - After input is collected, the wizard generates a score (0-100) for each selected school based on:
        - How well their profile matches the school’s admissions criteria.
        - Benchmarks from real accepted students (e.g., average GPA, test scores).
        - The user’s stated preferences (e.g., a high fit for Stanford if they value innovation and entrepreneurship).
3. **Actionable Insights**:
    
    - Breaks down the score with specific strengths and areas for improvement:
        - Example: "Your GPA and test scores are on par with Harvard’s average, but adding leadership experience could strengthen your application."
4. **School Comparison Dashboard**:
    
    - Radar chart visualization showing how the user compares to their top schools across key dimensions (academics, extracurriculars, etc.).
    - Allows users to toggle between schools and prioritize their applications.
5. **Call-to-Action**:
    
    - Recommendations link directly to Leland coaching services:
        - “Struggling with your essays? Book a session with one of our top admissions coaches.”
        - “Need help improving your extracurricular profile? Let a coach guide you!”
6. **Email Lead Generation**:

### MVP
For the MVP of the widget, a **progressive/dynamic input flow** would likely provide more value to the user, even if it's a simpler implementation. Here’s why:

### **Benefits of a Progressive/Dynamic Input Flow**

1. **Personalized Experience**:
    
    - Users feel guided through the process as the widget adapts based on their input.
    - This approach aligns with the idea of a "wizard" and enhances engagement.
2. **Simplifies Decision-Making**:
    
    - By presenting one input field at a time, users are less likely to feel overwhelmed.
    - Each step can be accompanied by context or tips (e.g., "Enter your GPA to see how you compare to top schools").
3. **Encourages Completion**:
    
    - Users are more likely to complete the form when they interact with a dynamic interface that feels conversational.
    - Progress indicators (e.g., "Step 2 of 5") provide a sense of achievement.
4. **Better Data Collection**:
    
    - Allows for conditional logic (e.g., "If GPA is below X, suggest schools where extracurriculars carry more weight").
    - Captures more accurate data as users focus on one aspect at a time.
